     The **Azure DevOps project** automatically configures a CI build and release trigger and Deploys application to the azure virtual machine. You're now ready to collaborate with a team on a ASP.NET Core app with a CI/CD process that automatically deploys your latest work to your web site.

## Exercise 2: Examine the VSTS CI/CD pipelines configured by Azure DevOps Project
  The Azure DevOps project automatically configured a full VSTS CI/CD pipeline in your VSTS account. You can explore and customize the pipeline as needed. Follow the steps below to familiarize yourself with the VSTS build and release definitions.

  1. Select **Build Pipelines** from the top of the Azure DevOps project dashboard. This link opens a browser tab and opens the VSTS build definition for your new project.

     ![buildpipelines](images/buildpipelines.png)


2. Select the **ellipsis** that appears. This action opens a menu where you can perform several activities such as queue a new build, pause a build, and edit the build definition. Select **Edit**.
      
    ![editbuild](images/editbuild.png)

3. From this view, **examine the various tasks** for your build definition. The build performs various tasks such as fetching sources from the Git repository, restoring dependencies, and publishing outputs used for deployments.

    ![builddefinition](images/builddefinition.png)

4. At the top of the build definition, select the **build definition name**. Change the name of your build definition to something more descriptive. Select **Save & queue**, then select **Save**.

    ![editbuilddfeinitionname](images/editbuilddfeinitionname.png)

5. Under your build definition name, select **History**. You see an audit trail of your recent changes for the build. VSTS keeps track of any changes made to the build definition, and allows you to compare versions.

   ![history](images/history.png)
   
6. Select **Triggers**. The Azure DevOps project automatically created a CI trigger, and every commit to the repository initiates a new build. You can optionally choose to include or exclude branches from the CI process.

   ![triggers](images/triggers.png)

7. Select **Retention**. Based on your scenario, you can specify policies to keep or remove a certain number of builds.

8. Select **Build and Release**, then choose **Releases**. The Azure DevOps project created a VSTS release definition to manage deployments to Azure.

   ![buildandrelease](images/buildandrelease.png)

9. On the left-hand side of the browser, select the **ellipsis** next to your release definition, then choose **Edit**.

   ![editrelease](images/editrelease.png)

10. The release definition contains a **pipeline**, which defines the release process. Under **Artifacts**, select **Drop**. The build definition you examined in the previous steps produces the output used for the artifact.

    ![releasedefinition](images/releasedefinition.png)

11. To the right-hand side of the **Drop** icon, select the **Continuous deployment trigger**. This release definition has an enabled CD trigger, which executes a deployment every time there is a new build artifact available. Optionally, you can disable the trigger, when your deployments require manual execution.

    ![cdtrigger](images/cdtrigger.png)


12. Select **Tasks**. The tasks are the activities your deployment process performs. In this example, you have three tasks with two [phases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/process/phases?view=vsts).

     ![viewtasks](images/viewtasks.png)

       ![releasetasks](images/releasetasks.png)

    **Phase 1**:  In this phase a task is added to add the virtual machine deployed using **Azure Devops project** to [Deployment Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/build-release/concepts/definitions/release/deployment-groups/?view=vsts). A deployment group is a logical set of deployment target machines that have agents installed on each one.

    **Pahse 2**: In this phase two tasks are added. One is to **Create a website** in virtual machine and the other is to **Deploy application to website**.

13. On the right-hand side of the browser, select **View releases**. This view shows a history of releases.
